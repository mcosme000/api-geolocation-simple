This is a practice I made with a weather API to show some weather data from different countries.

There is also the geolocation API and with that one it is also possible to look for the weather
on the current location. It is connected to the weather API with the geographic coordinates.

This is a very simple practice but I decided to create a new depository with this one
because I think I can use it for reference if I work with API and geolocation again.
